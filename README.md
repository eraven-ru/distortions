## welcome 
...to my small project with three.js textures' animations

-----------

I used three.js DataTexture and ShaderMaterial with a fragment shader to create the effect

I used Next.js as a base framework just cause I love it

-----------

Demo is [there](https://eraven.ru/distortions)

For the local stuff you know the drill

```bash
npm run dev

#or

npm run build
npm run start
```
